This is an Astro + TinaCMS project. It allows admin to log in and manage thoughts posts (blog posts). Tags are generated automatically by the tags fields on thoughts posts. Tags pages are automatically generated by the tags.

Driving ideas of the project are surprise, randomness, and unusual associations between seemingly unrelated thoughts, united by shared topics tags.

This project is a collaboration, and will be constantly changing with time.
