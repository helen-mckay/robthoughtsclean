# Rob Thoughts

A collaboration project with my friend. Will be a constant work in progress, starting small with eyes always on possible next features.

Live project here: https://robthoughts.me

Astro.js + TinaCMS, hosted with Vercel.

A clean-ish version of the project, with some folders removed and some content replaced with placeholder text.

## Up next:

Update this repo to have instructions on how to run locally.
